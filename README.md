This repository includes the provedure of training a pre-trained FlanT5 LLM to summarize dialogue between two persons. The code was inherited initially from a Coursera HW at [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/generative-ai-with-llms/home/week/1).
The models are prefetched from the *transformers* retrieved from the **Hugging Face**
